This branch is meant to be used with cmake! It's per kexin's reccomendation, and it's quite easy!

Steps: 
1. install cmake 
2. nagivate to IndexStructures directory (notice that there's a CMakeLists.txt in here. that's like a surrogate makefile). 
3. type 'cmake .'
4. a build folder should get made in the current directory, along with some other cmake files. 
5. and that's it! run 'make' whenever and it'll work (it creates an executable called "IndexStructures". 
just run './IndexStructures' and voila.
