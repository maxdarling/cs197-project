CS 197 Hash Table project

The goal of this project is to produce an adaptive hash table library to make
hash table implementations in read-write databases more effecient. 

Methods:

We are currently using C++ to implement the hash tables since C++ has efficiency 
guarantees and was the language used by our nearest neighbor paper called 
A seven dimensional analysis of hasing methods and its implications on the querying process.
